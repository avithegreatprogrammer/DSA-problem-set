## 🎯 Purpose & Vision

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build **strong algorithmic intuition**
- Practice **interview-grade problem solving**
- Explore **edge cases and optimizations**
- Maintain a **high-quality reference** for DSA concepts

Every solution focuses on:
- Correctness
- Time and space efficiency
- Readable, maintainable Python code

## 📘 200 Logical DSA Problems (Roadmap)

This repository also follows a **curated set of 200 logical DSA problems**, designed to strengthen fundamentals before moving to advanced concepts.

### Why this list?
- Covers **arrays-first logical thinking**
- Gradually increases difficulty
- Bridges the gap between **basic logic and advanced DSA**
- Ideal for consistency-driven practice (e.g., *2 problems/day*)

### Covered Phases
- **Phase 1:** Basic Logic & Arrays  
- **Phase 2:** Loops, Conditions & Patterns  
- **Phase 3:** Array Logic & Brute Force Optimization  
- **Phase 4:** Core DSA Thinking (Search, Stack, Sliding Window)  
- **Phase 5:** Logical & Matrix-Based Challenges  

Problems from this list are:
- Solved incrementally
- Optimized where applicable
- Used as a foundation before advanced LeetCode / AtCoder problems

> 📌 The full problem list is maintained as a reference and selectively implemented in this repository.
